# ProInput 0.5 by fernhw (@fern_hw, fernhw.com)
Manage Controllers in unity!
keep hold of controller profiles,
swap between them, map buttons in-game.

Unity's input system to put it in simple therms, sucks, you can't save controllers or even have full control of simple stuff like joystick axis without having to go through several hoops, and going through unity's regular controller mapping box is a pain if you want to, and let's be honest not have it, it's awful.

I tried other controller systems and none gave me the control I wanted, they all sucked. Now this is still in development and at the moment the thing is not complete, it works you can map controllers with the files in the Models folder, give it a whirl.

## Getting Started

### Step1 
First of all load this in your project, don't worry it wont bite, it's in it's own namespace titled ProInputSystem, comes with a class outside of the namespace called ProInput, that's your access point.

### Step2 
```
ProInput.UpdateInput(delta);
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
